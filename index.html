            <h2 class="section-title">GOAL</h2>
            <p>I am a high school student that has a strong passion for technology, especially computer science and computer 
                and hardware engineering. My passion started with gaming and wanting to upgrade my setup caused me to go out 
                of my comfort zone and build my first computer. Finding the thrill in that I found a passion in computers caused 
                me to sign up for computer science classes in school. Looking ahead, post college, I am eager to push myself and 
                collaborate with others to make a change in the computer and hardware industry.
